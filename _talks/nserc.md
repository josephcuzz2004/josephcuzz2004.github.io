My research group uses low cost, homebuilt laser systems for experiments in precision metrology, such as measurements of
gravitational acceleration using laser cooled atoms, confined in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). We have constructed a feedback
system for stabilizing the laser intensity in this experiment that uses an analog circuit and an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). A portion
of the light diffracted by the AOM is incident on a photodetector. The signal from the photodetector is compared to a setpoint voltage
using a subtractor in the first stage of the analog circuit. In the second stage, the subtractor output is amplified and integrated with
a time constant that can be as small as 100 Âµs. In the final stage, the integrated signal is added to a stable offset voltage, and the
resulting signal controls a radio frequency (RF) attenuator that modulates a voltage controlled oscillator driving the AOM. In this
scheme, if the laser power fluctuates, the RF signal to the AOM changes so as to stabilize the laser intensity. We investigate the
suitability of this feedback loop for stabilizing the fluorescence from the MOT and the impact of stabilizing the atom number on a variety of experiments
