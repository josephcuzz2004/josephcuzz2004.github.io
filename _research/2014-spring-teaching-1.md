Ultra-cold quantum gases provide a versatile platform for studying phenomena such as unitary interactions and non-equilibrium dynamics. In this work, a degenerate gas of fermionic 40K is prepared beneath an atom chip via evaporative cooling and optical confinement. Conventional harmonic trapping using red-detuned Gaussian beams produces a strongly inhomogeneous atomic cloud density, which complicates physical interpretations and limits the breadth of experiments which can be conducted.

To address this limitation, I have executed the implementation of a class of next generation atom traps, known as an optical box trap, based on a hollow, blue-detuned ring potential with sharply defined walls, yielding a spatially homogeneous atomic cloud. The ring potential is generated using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD), which is combined with orthogonally propagating, highly elliptical end-cap beams to form a three-dimensional, box-like confinement geometry. Gravitational effects are compensated via RF-induced magnetic levitation using dressed atomic states.

This approach significantly simplifies experimental analysis and expands the range of accessible quantum gas experiments. The work concudcted involved the theoretical framework, intense numerical simulations, data analysis, optical design, and construction of the system.
