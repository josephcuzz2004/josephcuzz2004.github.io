I have developed an analog feedback system to stabilize the intensity of diode lasers for precision metrology experiments. A fraction of diffracted light from an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) is monitored with a photodetector and compared to a setpoint voltage, producing an error signal that is amplified and integrated with time constants as short as 100 µs to regulate the RF drive to the AOM.

System performance was characterized through extensive signal data analysis, including time-series noise analysis, data cleaning, and nonlinear regression to optimize feedback parameters and quantify stability improvements. The feedback loop suppresses laser intensity fluctuations over timescales from 100 µs to 20 ms, reducing noise by more than a factor of three.

A TTL-triggered sample-and-hold module enables stabilization during pulsed operation. Comparable noise suppression was observed in pulsed and continuous modes, demonstrating the system’s robustness and applicability to pulsed laser experiments.
