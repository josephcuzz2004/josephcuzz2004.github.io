We discuss the specifications of a home-built external cavity diode laser system that is suitable for cold-atom velocimetry and measurements of gravity. The laser system is frequency stabilized using a modulation-free technique which results in a lower temperature magneto-optical trap (MOT) compared to a MOT realized using a diode laser that relies on lock-in spectroscopy. The laser system also relies on a feedback loop involving an acousto-optic modulator for intensity stabilization, which reduces the effect of low frequency vibrations. By integrating this laser with a home-built, dual output radio frequency (RF) synthesizer, we are able to derive two laser beams with a precisely controlled relative detuning for frequency domain interferometry using laser-cooled atoms. The detuning can range from the mHz to the MHz level with a stability of 10 Î¼Hz.
