I am a fourth-year Specialized Honours Physics student at York University, conducting experimental research in quantum optics and atomic physics at the University of Toronto. My work focuses on the interaction of ultracold atoms in engineered optical potentials to study complex quantum phenomena.

My present research project involves the design and construction of an optical box trap for quantum gases, using sharply sculpted, blue-detuned laser potentials to confine fermionic potassium-40 atoms in a uniform trap. This approach improves upon traditional harmonic traps by eliminating resultant atomic cloud density inhomogeneities, significantly simplifying experimental interpretation and enabling access to regimes that are otherwise difficult or impossible to study. The project integrates optical system design, beam shaping, acousto-optics, optomechanics, computational simulation, and data analysis, and has required close collaboration within a large experimental research team.

Previously, I developed feedback and control systems for laser intensity and frequency stabilization, including an analog AOM-based intensity stabilization circuit and the construction of an AOM-modulated laser locking system for rubidium spectroscopy. These systems were applied to precision atomic physics experiments and recognized nationally, earning Top 8 Research Presentation distinction at the 2024 Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference.

Through my work in experimental physics, I have developed a strong expertise in advanced data analysis, signal processing, and Python programming. Through side projects and coursework, I have also gained experience in exploratory data analysis and machine learning applied to large scientific datasets. I am broadly interested in problems concerning ultracold quantum systems, photonics, computation, precision measurements, and in developing robust experimental and analytical tools for such complex systems.
