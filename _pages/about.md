I am a fourth-year Specialized Honours Physics student at York University, conducting experimental research in quantum optics and atomic physics at the University of Toronto. My work focuses on the interaction of ultracold atoms in engineered optical potentials to study complex quantum phenomena.

My current research focuses on the design and construction of an optical box trap for quantum gases, using sculpted laser potentials to confine potassium-40 atoms in a uniform trap. This approach improves upon traditional harmonic traps by eliminating the associated density inhomogeneities, significantly simplifying experimental interpretation and enabling access to regimes that are otherwise difficult or impossible to study. The project integrates optical system design, beam shaping, acousto-optics, optomechanics, computational simulation, and data analysis, and has required close collaboration within a large experimental research team.

Previously, I developed feedback and control systems for laser intensity and frequency stabilization, including an analog circuit and acousto-optic modulator (AOM) based intensity stabilization scheme and the construction of an AOM-modulated laser locking system for rubidium spectroscopy. The intensity feedback system has since been applied to precision atomic physics experiments and published in a manuscript in a well known journal. Furthermore, I presented my results at a local and national conference where I was recognized, earning Top 8 Research Presentation distinction at the 2024 Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference.

Through my work in experimental physics, I have also developed a strong expertise in advanced data analysis, signal processing, and Python programming. Through side projects and coursework, I have gained experience in exploratory data analysis and machine learning applied to large scientific datasets. I am broadly interested in problems concerning ultracold quantum systems, photonics, computation, precision measurements, and in developing robust experimental and analytical tools for such complex systems. In addition, I am particulalry interested in applying quantitative analysis and data-driven solutions to real world problems in technology, finance and beyond.
