## Research Experience

### Quantum Optics - University of Toronto  
**Optical Box Trap for Ultracold Quantum Gases**  
*Apr 2025 – Sep 2025*

- Designed and implemented a fully functional optical box trap for ultracold atomic gases, including planning, simulation, optical design, testing, and experimental realization.
- Replaced harmonic trapping potentials, which produce inhomogeneous atomic densities, with a box-like optical potential, yielding a spatially homogeneous atomic cloud.
- Implemented sharply sculpted, blue-detuned optical potentials to confine a 3D cloud of \(^{40}\mathrm{K}\) atoms.
- Applied advanced knowledge of atomic physics, statistical mechanics, Fourier optics, and atom trapping techniques.
- Developed and aligned complex optical systems involving fiber coupling, beam shaping, acousto-optics, optomechanics, and imaging.
- Performed computational simulations and data analysis to validate experimental and theoretical results.
- Collaborated within a large research group, managing milestones and coordinating experimental development.
