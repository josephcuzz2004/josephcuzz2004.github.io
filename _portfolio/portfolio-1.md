title: "Classifying Neutrino Flavor Based on Optical Signal In IceCube Neutrino Observatory Final Data Exploration and Applied Machine Learning Technique"
excerpt: " I present the final exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applied
 machine learning results for the IceCube dataset, regarding methods
 of neutrino flavor classification. I utilize different statistical techniques
 ranging from Gaussian analysis, correlation matrices, random forest
 regression, k-means clustering, among others to group, classify and
 predict neutrino flavour from the interaction events detected by Ice
Cube. In particular, I use the parameters of hits per unit of optical
 measurement to decipher the neutrino flavour based on key differ
ences initially observed by simulations of these events. While results
 are not conclusive, it would seem that with a more thorough analy
sis, this method can be a useful means to classify neutrino flavour of
 events detected at IceCube 1<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
